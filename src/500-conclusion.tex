\chapter{\label{chap:conclusion}Conclusion}

In this thesis we have examined how CPS can be improved upon as an IR. We have proposed command trees as a solution, which helps both language implementers and compiler writers. Our new compilation scheme is validated by using it to implement LamToWat, a compiler from the lambda calculus to WA.
