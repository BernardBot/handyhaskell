%I would like to thank my supervisor Casper Bach Poulsen for introducing me to Haskell. His guidance and our weekly meetings were essential to the completion of this thesis. I think my view on programming has been changed permanently (for the better?).

%I would also like to thank my parents for motivating me to finish writing this document. If they had not pushed me, I would now be constructing the 30th version of the LamToWat compiler.

%A special thanks goes to my roommates, who helped me release stress when it was necessary. Another special thanks goes to my friends from the library, who helped me put things in perspective.
