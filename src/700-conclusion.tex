\chapter{\label{chap:conclusion}Conclusion}

In this thesis we have examined how \ac{CPS} can be improved upon as an \ac{IR}. We have proposed command trees as a solution, which helps both language implementers and compiler writers. Two versions of command trees, semantic and syntactic are needed for compilation. The abstractions of semantic command trees prove useful when implementing a language, but are not malleable enough for other compilation steps. Our new compilation scheme is validated by using it to implement LamToWat, a compiler from the lambda calculus to \ac{WA}.
