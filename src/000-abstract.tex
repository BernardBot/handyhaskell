Compilers translate high-level source code into low-level machine code. An intermediate representation is the language a compiler uses to represent source code. Continuation-passing style is an intermediate representation for functional compilation \autocite{steele1978rabbit, DBLP:books/daglib/0022396}. It provides abstractions for both data flow and control flow.

In this thesis we develop an IR based on command trees \autocite{commandtreespoulsen}. Command trees allow us to express compiler transformations typically, declaratively and modularly. The monadic nature of command trees allows us to bind commands together in a manner that matches the control flow.

We test command trees by building two versions of the LamToWat compiler that translates WebAssembly into the lamdba calculus. One version will be based on the original CPS and the other version on command trees.
