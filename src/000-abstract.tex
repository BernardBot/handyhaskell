Compilers translate high-level source code into low-level machine code. To represent source code a compiler uses a language called the intermediate representation. An intermediate representation for the compilation of functional languages is continuation-passing style \autocite{steele1978rabbit, DBLP:books/daglib/0022396}. It provides convenient abstractions for both data flow and control flow.

In this thesis we develop an IR based on CPS using the command tree data structure \autocite{commandtreespoulsen}. Command trees allow us to express compiler transformations typically, declaratively and modularly. The monadic nature of command trees allows us to bind commands together in a succinct manner.

We test the usefulness of the new IR by building two versions of the LamToWat compiler that translates the lamdba calculus into WebAssembly. The first version will use a CPS IR and the second version a command tree IR.
